# An-Interpretable-Deep-Learning-Approach-to-Detect-Alzheimer-Using-MRI-Images

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a serious neurological condition that causes loss of long-term memory, cognitive
difficulties, disorientation, inconsistent behavior, and eventually
death. AD also destroys brain cells needed for cognitive function.
The main focus of our research is to provide an efficient
model for the rapid diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. In this
research, we design and demonstrate an interpretable deeplearning approach to detect Alzheimer’s using MRI images. For
the experiment, brain MRIs are utilized, and by using this data,
the model is able to determine the disease. For Alzheimer’s
patients in different stages, this model uses multi class categorization (MildDemented, ModerateDemented, NonDemented,
VeryMildDemented). For this research, we experimented with
four different architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks.
VGG-19 had 92.65% accuracy, DenseNet-169 89.18%, ResNet50 V2 87.84%, and Inception V3 80.10%. By comparing model
performance, the result may be improved by up to 92.65%, and
the system is built using the best architecture (VGG19). Despite a
shortage of data, the results accurately identified and categorized
Alzheimer’s disease and its stages. Lastly, GradCam (GradientWeighted Class Activation Mapping) is implemented to make
the application of Explainable AI(XAI) apparent. Therefore, the
proposed system would enable the detection and interpretation
of Alzheimer’s disease effectively.
